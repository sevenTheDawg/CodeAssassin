# CodeAssassin
Final Project from GA's Front End Web Development Class, Winter 2015. 
What would I do next?
  Create a form that you get to by clicking the kitty
    The form would include contact fields and a place to copy/paste your obfuscated code and your credit card info
  Make the kitty disappear after the step one box
  Make the resources clickable
  Include more funny remarks inspired by the site title
